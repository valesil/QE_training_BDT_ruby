1. When and why BDD was defined

2. The most important aspects of BDD
* It is an approach that allow to specify the tests in terms of the expected behavior for the features o user stories
* The tests become an executable documentation of the features
* All the people involved in the development process should be involved, using a unique language (bussiness oriented rather than technical)
	- PO -> Acceptance criteria
	- Developers -> Implement the user story to pass the scenarios to satisfy the acceptance criteria
	- Testers -> Validates the feature satisfies the expected behavior

3. Why is useful and when could be applied.
* It is especially useful when the application business is complex
